# United Kingdom

# From Peter Ilieve (peter@memex.co.uk) (July 4, 1989)
#
# From the UK Government paper "Summer Time: A Consultation Document"
# (HMSO Cm722 June 1989), which is about the possibility of the UK moving
# into the central European timezone and synchronising its summer time with
# the rest of Europe (by moving the end date back a month to end Sep.,
# the start dates are already the same).
#
# Summer time was not observed before 1916.
# It was introduced in the First World War in response to its introduction
# by Germany in March 1916.
# During the Second World War normal summer time was used in Winter and double
# summer time was used in Summer.
# Between 1968 and 1971 GMT+1 was used all year as an experiment.
# This caused voluble objections in Scotland and the experiment was judged
# a failure.
#
# Although it does not say what happens in Europe, it does say that most
# of Europe did not use summer time until 1979, presumably dropping it
# after the 1st and/or 2nd war.
#
# Note that this is not necessarily accurate for Eire.
#
# The paper gives a complete record of dates from 1916, and dates up to 1992.
# The intention is to have the new system, if any, start in 1993.
# The dates are (copied exactly from the table in the paper):
#

# From Paul Eggert (October 14, 1993)
#
# I changed the date `30 April 1924' to `13 April 1924' in the above table
# to fix what must be transcription error, since 30 April is not a Sunday,
# and Shanks gives 13 April which is a Sunday.
#
# The rules for Eire below are taken from Shanks, and reflect his claim that
# Eire changed the clock twice on 1 Oct 1916.  I invented `IST' and `IDT' as
# abbreviations for Eire's standard and daylight time before 1 Oct 1916.

# From Arthur David Olson (January 19, 1989):
#
# A source at the British Information Office in New York avers that it's
# known as "British" Summer Time in all parts of the United Kingdom.

# From an Anonymous U. K. Donor (January 4, 1989):
#
# It is NOT possible to predict when [British Summer Time] will change
# in a future year.
#
# (The admiralty calculate when they think it should be (no more that a couple
# of years in advance) and advise the government who then decide whether or
# not they will take the admiralty's advice)
#
# ...the Gre[e]nwich...observatory...[was] very helpful.
#
# I was not able to track down the Admiralty formula (I tried hard but failed)

# ...
# Date: 4 Jan 89 08:57:25 GMT (Wed)
# From: Jonathan Leffler <nih-csl!uunet!mcvax!sphinx.co.uk!john>
# ...
# [British Summer Time] is fixed annually by Act of Parliament.
# If you can predict what Parliament will do, you should be in
# politics making a fortune, not computing.

# From Peter Ilieve (peter@memex.co.uk) (September 3, 1993)
#
# I have some more up to date info.
# 
# Our Government...couldn't...make a decision after the 1989 consultation
# exercise about the UK changing its timezone so it just let things drift
# (different from deciding to keep the status quo).  According to the
# Summer Time Order 1992 (SI 1992/1729) the dates of Summer Time for 1993
# and 1994 are:
# 		Start		End
# 1993	28 March	24 October
# 1994	27 March	23 October
# All start and end times are at 01:00 GMT.
# 
# There [was] an error in your tables for the start and end times prior to 1981.
# The UK always used to change at 02:00 GMT. In 1981 it changed to 01:00 GMT
# as a part of EC harmonisation and has remained at that time since.
# 
# I have found the default algorithm for UK Summer Time, it is in the
# Summer Time Act 1972. Section 1 states that in the absence of an Order
# in Council Summer Time starts at 02:00 GMT on the morning of the day
# after the third Saturday in March, unless that day is Easter Day, in
# which case it is the morning of the day after the second Saturday.
# It ends at 02:00 GMT on the morning of the day after the fourth Saturday
# in October. (All the redundant `morning of the day ...' is in the Act.)
# This is only of passing interest now as it will always be overridden by
# an Order in Council (a Statutary Instrument, the SI thing mentioned above)
# to specify the EC specified dates.
# 
# Your comment in the tables about UK starting double summer time on a Monday
# in 1945 prompted me to ask the Home Office about this. They didn't really
# know (there was a war on at the time and summer time was specified by
# Defence Regulations, different department, long time ago, etc.), but it was
# listed as 2 April in a previous consultation paper from 1970 so if it is
# a typo it was in that paper or before and was just copied into the 1989
# paper. I have a few other avenues to explore on this and will let you know
# the outcome.

# 
# The ending rule here doesn't match the EC rules, which specify the fourth
# Sunday in October for the UK and Eire. The `fourth Sunday' rule wasn't
# followed in 1989, but then the sixth EC directive wasn't in force then
# and I don't know what previous ones said. 1995 is the next year with
# the 4th Sun on 22 Oct, but that year isn't covered by the UK Summer Time
# Order or the sixth EC directive. Your Oct Sun>=23 rule matches history
# and with things only announced for 2 years or so in advance who knows
# what will happen.
# 
# There are renewed rumours that the Government here will make another
# attempt at resolving this issue, which is what prompted me to start
# asking the Home Office and the EC about it again. The EC categorically
# state they are not asking anybody to change timezone, they only want
# common start/end dates. The UK Govt. seem to want to change our zone
# and blame the resulting fuss on the EC. Me, I think we should scrap
# summer time completely, noon is when the Sun is overhead, and that should
# be the end of it.

# ...the European time rules are...standardized since 1981, when
# most European coun[tr]ies started DST.  Before that year, only
# a few countries (UK, France, Italy) had DST, each according
# to own national rules.  In 1981, however, DST started on
# 'Apr firstSun', and not on 'Mar lastSun' as in the following
# years...
# But also since 1981 there are some more national exceptions
# than listed in 'europe': Switzerland, for example, joined DST
# one year later, Denmark ended DST on 'Oct 1' instead of 'Sep
# lastSun' in 1981---I don't know how they handle now.
#
# Finally, DST ist always from 'Apr 1' to 'Oct 1' in the
# Soviet Union (as far as I know).

#
# The information from Tom Hofmann is (as far as I know) not entirely correct.
# After a request from chongo at amdahl I tried to retrieve all information
# about DST in Europe.  I was able to find all from about 1969.
#
# ...standardization on DST in Europe started in about 1977 with switches on
# first Sunday in April and last Sunday in September...
# In 1981 UK joined Europe insofar that
# the starting day for both shifted to last Sunday in March.  And from 1982
# the whole of Europe used DST, with switch dates April 1 and October 1 in
# the Sov[i]et Union.  In 1985 the SU reverted to standard Europe[a]n switch
# dates...
#
# It should also be remembered that time-zones are not constants; e.g.
# Portugal switched in 1976 from MET (or CET) to WET with DST...
# Note also that though there were rules for switch dates not
# all countries abided to these dates, and many individual deviations
# occurred, though not since 1982 I believe.  Another note: it is always
# assumed that DST is 1 hour ahead of normal time, this need not be the
# case; at least in the Netherlands there have been times when DST was 2 hours
# in advance of normal time.

# Turning to Europe, I now have a copy of the `Sixth Council Directive 92/20/EEC
# of 26 March 1992 on summertime arrangements'. This only covers 1993 and
# 1994, a seventh one is in the works but I doubt that the algorithm will
# change. This says summertime starts at 01:00 GMT on the last Sunday in March
# and ends at 01:00 GMT on the last Sunday in September, except for the UK
# and Eire where it ends at 01:00 GMT on the fourth Sunday in October.
# It says the arrangements for 1995 onwards will be decided by 1 January 1994,
# but as the sixth directive was supposed to appear by 1 Jan 92 and didn't
# arrive til March I wouldn't hold your breath.
# 
# The first summertime directive was adopted in 1980, although the UK didn't
# seem to use it until 1981. I suspect it would be safe to move your start
# dates for the -Eur rules back to 1981.
