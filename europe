# 
# ...the European time rules are...standardized since 1981, when
# most European counrties started DST.  Before that year, only
# a few countries (UK, France, Italy) had DST, each according
# to own national rules.  In 1981, however, DST started on
# 'Apr firstSun', and not on 'Mar lastSun' as in the following
# years...
# But also since 1981 there are some more national exceptions 
# than listed in 'europe': Switzerland, for example, joined DST 
# one year later, Denmark ended DST on 'Oct 1' instead of 'Sep 
# lastSun' in 1981---I don't know how they handle now.
# 
# Finally, DST ist always from 'Apr 1' to 'Oct 1' in the
# Soviet Union (as far as I know).

# ...
# 
# The information from Tom Hofmann is (as far as I know) not entirely correct.
# After a request from chongo at amdahl I tried to retrieve all information
# about DST in Europe.  I was able to find all from about 1969.
# 
# ...standardization
# on DST in Europe started in about 1977 with switches on first Sunday in
# April and last Sunday in September.  In UK it was from last but 1 Sunday
# in march to last Sunday in October.  In 1981 UK joined Europe insofar that
# the starting day for both shifted to last Sunday in March.  And from 1982
# the whole of Europe used DST, with switch dates April 1 and October 1 in
# the Sovjet Union.  In 1985 the SU reverted to standard Europen switch
# dates.  Note that currently in the UK the switch back date appears not
# to be the last Sunday in October, but 4 weeks after the last Sunday in
# September (withness 1982 and 1983 with terminating days October 24 and 23).
# 
# It should also be remembered that time-zones are not constants; e.g.
# Portugal switched in 1976 from MET (or CET) to WET with DST, and the UK
# used MET throughout from 1967 to 1969, and WET with DST before and after
# that time.  Note also that though there were rules for switch dates not
# all countries abided to these dates, and many individual deviations
# occurred, though not since 1982 I believe.  Another note: it is always
# assumed that DST is 1 hour ahead of normal time, this need not be the
# case; at least in the Netherlands there have been times when DST was 2 hours
# in advance of normal time.
